# Saasapp Mobile

Expo / React Native app for Saasapp, built with [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction)
(`expo-router`). It talks to the same backend as [`saasapp-web`](../saasapp-web) through the shared, generated
[`saasapp-apiclient`](../../packages/saasapp-apiclient) package — no hand-written HTTP calls.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (this app lives in the `frontend/` pnpm workspace, alongside
  `saasapp-web`)
- The backend running and reachable — see the root [README](../../../README.md#getting-started) for how to start
  PostgreSQL/MailDev and the Spring Boot API
- To run on a device/simulator: [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) for the fastest loop, or a
  [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) for anything this app uses
  that Expo Go doesn't support (see `expo-dev-client` in `package.json`)
- Xcode (iOS simulator) and/or Android Studio (Android emulator), if you want native simulators instead of Expo Go

## Setup

From the repository root:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

```bash
cd apps/saasapp-mobile
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` isn't required to start the app — every value has a sensible default — but you'll usually want to at least
confirm `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` points at your backend:

| Variable                    | Purpose                                                                              | Default                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_ENV`                    | `development` \| `staging` \| `production` — selects the default API/web-app origins in `app.config.ts`. EAS build profiles set this automatically (see [EAS Build](#eas-build)) | `development`                                          |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`    | Overrides the environment's default backend URL                                       | `http://localhost:8080` in development                |

Then start the app:

```bash
pnpm start
```

This opens the Expo CLI, from which you can launch an iOS simulator, Android emulator, or scan the QR code with
Expo Go. Platform-specific shortcuts:

```bash
pnpm ios       # expo run:ios
pnpm android   # expo run:android
pnpm web       # expo start --web
```

> On a physical device, `localhost` in the API base URL resolves to the phone, not your dev machine.
> `src/constants/env.ts` already rewrites it to the address Expo's dev server was reached on
> (`Constants.expoConfig.hostUri`), so this only matters if you're hitting a non-local backend.

## Available scripts

| Script               | What it does                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm start`          | Starts the Expo dev server                                                    |
| `pnpm ios` / `android` | Builds and runs a native dev client on a simulator/emulator                   |
| `pnpm web`            | Runs the app in a browser via `react-native-web`                              |
| `pnpm lint`           | `expo lint` — ESLint with `eslint-config-expo`                                |
| `pnpm typecheck`      | `tsc --noEmit`                                                                |
| `pnpm build`          | `expo export` — bundles all platforms; used by CI as a compile/bundle smoke test, **not** a native binary (see [EAS Build](#eas-build) for that) |
| `pnpm reset-project`  | Expo's own scaffold-reset script (not used day-to-day in this app)            |

## CI

[`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) at the repo root runs `lint`, `typecheck`, and
`build` for this app on every push/PR to `main`, alongside a `format` job (Prettier, whole `frontend/` workspace)
and a `web` job for `saasapp-webapp`.

## EAS Build

[`eas.json`](./eas.json) defines two build profiles:

- **`development`** — internal distribution, includes the dev client (`expo-dev-client`), points at
  `APP_ENV=development`
- **`preview`** — internal distribution, standalone (no dev client), points at `APP_ENV=staging`

Actually running a build (`eas build --profile development`) requires the project to be linked to a real
[EAS](https://expo.dev/eas) account first (`eas init`), which hasn't been done yet.
